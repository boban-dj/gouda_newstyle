			<h5>The Fluid Baseline Grid System is an HTML5 <span class="amp">&amp;</span> CSS3 development kit that provides a solid foundation to quickly design websites with ease.</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="g3">
			<p>The <abbr title="Fluid Baseline Grid">FBG</abbr> system was built with typographic standards in mind and combines principals of fluid-column layouts, baseline grids and mobile-first responsive design into a resolution independent and device agnostic framework. It is packed with CSS normalization, beautiful typographic standards, corrected bugs, common browser inconsistencies and improved usability. You can finally have your cake and eat it too, all while making awesome websites.</p>

			<h3>Is she dead, yes or no?</h3>
			<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="g1">
			<h3>I'm serious as a heart attack</h3>
			<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? That's what you see at a toy store.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="g1">
			<h3>Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!</h3>
			<p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="g2">
			<h3>Your bones don't break, mine do</h3>
			<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="g1">
			<h3>I can do that</h3>
			<p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="g3">
			<h3>Shoot that bitch in the kneecaps</h3>
			<p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>
